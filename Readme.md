TODOs:

- Settle on naming Convention/Lint
- Figure out how we want to pass controls into commands (Providers or a gobal controlBoard class)
- Move core package to different repo
- Decide if we keep the reverse domain package convention with jmhsrobotics.org
- Figure out the structure for unit tests
- Fine tune git ignore
